# magnetic-sensor
 
Implemented a magnetic sensor system with STM32 L432KC, using XBee to establish communication of data between system and server

Server source code was written by Python. System source code was written by C, with the base code of STM32CubeMX.

The main purpose of the project is to learn how to program data transfer communication with XBee and finalize a full product of an IOT system
